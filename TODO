- Compare two projects
- Modtime-based quick check (requires all that modtime resolution junk); some of the projects
  I've run into were in the dozens of GBs, which gets impractical.
- Last modified date from git/hg revisions
- When looking for a project, define priority order (i.e. simpleproj in the same dir as git takes precedence)
