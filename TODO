- Compare two projects
- Modtime-based quick check (requires all that modtime resolution junk); some of the projects
  I've run into were in the dozens of GBs, which gets impractical.
- Last modified date from git/hg revisions
- Ignore nested git/hg repos when finding: top level is the project (disable with flag)
